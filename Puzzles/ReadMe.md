# Puzzles

These are a few of the puzzles I created for my current project. 

#### Multiple Choice Question

This is a very basic, and simple puzzle. It loads a questions from the PuzzleManager and provides buttons with possible answers.

#### Slide Puzzle

Taken from the classic (and frustrating) little puzzles from our childhood, this puzzle will take any image given, as well as a two dimensional tile count, and generate a grid of puzzles piece tiles. It can mix and move the pieces traditionally (only the tiles next to the empty space), or more with a new varient (any piece can swap with the empty one). The player must return all tiles to their original location and reassemble the puzzle.
