# Squads

*Squads* is an early in development project I'm working on, with the goal being to create infrastructure for a simple character design environment, that is easily extendable to add a lot of depth and complexity, but also maximizes minimal dependency.

This project is still in it's early stages, but I think shows the thought and approach I'm taking with it, and where it could go. With the project, I wanted to accomplish the design idea I had to see if it could function, and be fun, as a game, while maximizing simplicity, clean code concepts, and extendibility.

## Brief Explaination of the gameplay

*Squads* is a third person mulitiplayer action game, with 1v1, 2v1 or 2v2 game modes. The player will have a pool of points to use to contruct a team of characters, each with their own stats, controls, abilities, optional upgrades, and available weapons. 

During the match, the player can oversee their known parts of the map from Commander view, and choose which character to switch to next. The player will need to balance their character choices, and time/actions with each character to complete their objects before the other team completes theirs.
