# Squads

Squads is an early in development project I'm working on, with the goal being to create infrastructure for a simple character design environment, that is easily extendable to add a lot of depth and complexity, but also maximizes minimal dependency.

This project is still in it's early stages, but I think shows the thought and approach I'm taking with it, and where it could go.
